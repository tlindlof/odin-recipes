    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the renowned lasagna of Odin himself. A mere bite of this pasta dish is enough to get you wearing an eyepatch and start talking to ravens</p>
    <p>Some of the ingredients can be hard to find. I allways go grocery shopping in the Aldi in west Joutunheimen, they allways carry the things i need.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>300g Pasta sheets</li>
        <li>500g Ground goat</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>1,2kg Crushed tomatoes (Canned)</li>
        <li>1 Onion (Small)</li>
        <li>2 Lingon berries</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Skin and grind the goat with the medium corse setting on your goat grinder</li>
        <li>Peel one (1) small onion and dice it</li>
        <li>Fry the onion until translucent as the Bifrost</li>
        <li>Add the ground up goat and fry until browned</li>
        <li>Add one lingonberry and look at it.</li>
        <li>Realize that lingonberry in a lasagna is lunacy. Remove the lingonberry!</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the ingredients. Let cook for a time eqivalent to three or four powernaps (Depending how long your powernaps usually are)</li>
        <li>Taste and <s>adjust seasoning</s> realize that you added the second lingonberry in step 7. Your day is now ruined.</li>
    </ol>
