# Odin recipes excersise

## *Expectations*

This exercise in HTML is a part of the [odin projects](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curicculum  

I am expected to create a simple recipe page. For this I'm expecting to use ordered/unordered lists, headings and paragraphs and links. 

To get started i need to create an index.html file and write( insert via VSCode shortcut) the boilerplate for the index file.

I also get to work with git for the first time.

## *Starting point and points of focus*

I have worked with some basic HTML and CSS before, but i doubt that i will remember much of the css part.  

The aspect of the project i want to focus on is using git and writing meaningful commit-messages, alltough it it is hardly nessecary for this kind of project.

As a gague for progress and a tool to get used to documenting what i learn, I am intending to use the README as a place for documenting the intention of the exersise, what i expect from the project and what i have learned.
